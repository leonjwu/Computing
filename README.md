# Computing Projects

# [Project 1: Computational PDEs: 1D and 2D Wave Equations](https://leonjwu.github.io/comp-pdes/)

## Overview
- Implemented finite difference schemes for 1D and 2D Wave Equations
- Designed boundary conditions to allow for reflecting and non-reflecting boundaries (Neumann and Dirichlet)
- Created visualisations of 1D and 2D waves using Matplotlib Animations

# [Project 2: Simulating Fluid Flow PDEs with Finite Differences and Simulating Weakly-Coupled Oscillattors on a network (Parallel Fortran (OMP and MPI))](https://github.com/leonjwu/Computing/blob/master/Fluid-Oscillators/)

## Overview
- Simulated blood flow through a deformed artery
- Designed fast sparse matrix solvers in parallel Fortran code (OMP) to speedup the bottleneck in the finite-difference schemes by 100x
- Simulated Weakly-Coupled Osicalltors on a network using 1D and 2D decompositions for MPI parallel Computing in Fortran.
- Setup communication effectively between multiple processes on a grid using appropriate MPI directives
- Implemented finite difference methods in Python

# [Project 4: Volatility Surface Simulator](https://leonjwu.github.io/volatility-simulator/)

## Overview
- Created a webapp for options trading and pricingt, enabling market makers and traders to visualise real-time and historical simulations of volatility surfaces, market quotes, and trades
- Using the tool, you can view proprietary implied volatility surface marks generated from my own model, and explore live or historical volatility surfaces in 2D or 3D through simulation
- Also built a volatility surface simulator - an internal backtesting tool to backtest and benchmark my own improvements to the production volatilty model
