# [Project 2: Simulating Fluid Flow PDEs with Finite Differences and Simulating Weakly-Coupled Oscillattors on a network (Parallel Fortran (OMP and MPI))](https://github.com/leonjwu/Computing/blob/master/Fluid-Oscillators/)

## Overview
- Simulated blood flow through a deformed artery
- Designed fast sparse matrix solvers in parallel Fortran code (OMP) to speedup the bottleneck in the finite-difference schemes by 100x
- Simulated Weakly-Coupled Osicalltors on a network using 1D and 2D decompositions for MPI parallel Computing in Fortran.
- Setup communication effectively between multiple processes on a grid using appropriate MPI directives
- Implemented finite difference methods in Python
