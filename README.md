# [Project 1: Simulating Bacteria Dynamics in Python and Parallel Fortran](https://github.com/leonwu4951/Computing/blob/master/Bacteria/)

## Overview
- Developed vectorised Python code using NumPy and SciPy for bacteria simulations
- Analysed dynamics of the simulations with various plots
- Developed parallel Fortran code using OMP for the simulations, resulting in a 100x speedup over the vectorised Python code through better memory management and parallelisation
